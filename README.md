# Overview

## A Little History

[ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA) originially was an early natural language processing computer program created from 1964 to 1966 at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by [Joseph Weizenbaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weizenbaum). The original program was implemented on the IBM 7094 of the Project MAC time-sharing system at MIT and was written in MAD-SLIP.

## The Project

This project was a small school assignment and it mereley mirrors Eliza, the psychotherapist over at [masswerk.at/elizabot](https://www.masswerk.at/elizabot/) and all the credits belong to them. This project is based on the DOCTOR script, which was built on top of Eliza in the context of psychotherapy. And the best part.. it speaks!
